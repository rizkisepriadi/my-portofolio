              My name is Muhammad Rizki Sepriadi, and Iâ€™m a college student at
              Sriwijaya University, majoring in Informatics. I am passionate
              about front-end development and have self-proclaimed myself as a
              full-stack developer. I am very enthusiastic about learning and
              bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to
              life. User experience, and writing clear, readable, highly
              performant code are important to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in front-end development began during my time as a
              senior high school student. I became serious about learning web
              development when I started studying Informatics at Sriwijaya
              University. Since then, I have cont inued to grow and evolve as a
              developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest
              technologies along the way. I build cutting-edge web applications
              using modern technologies such as Next.js, React, Laravel,
              Tailwind CSS, and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong advocate
              for teamwork and collaboration. I believe that the best products
              are created through effective communication and collective effort.
              I enjoy working with designers, product managers, and other
              developers to create seamless user experiences. My goal is to
              continuously improve my skills and contribute to projects that
              make a meaningful impact
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look
              forward to connecting and collaborating on exciting projects.
